# Backlog Buddy

## Overview

The perfect companion for all your games still sitting on the shelf or collecting virtual dust in your library.
The aim of this website is to have a searchable list of games for users to add to their personal backlog. Users
can make this list public to be visible to other users who make accounts and login. Users can then go to other
users' list and "upvote" games that they think are worth checking out next.

For reference, a "backlog" of games refers to a growing number of games someone has purchased, usually from a sale, that
the haven't gotten around to playing yet. Steam users know the pain!

## User Stories

1. The user arrives at the landing page with a description about the site, as well as options to log in or sign up.
2. The sign up and login screens are both seperate screen which when logged in, will take users to the main dashboard.
3. The site will remember the user and take them to the dashboard upon entering the site as well.
4. The main dashboard contains a search bar which will pull from a huge list of games. A persisting nav bar is also present with relevant links.
5. After searching a game, the search bar will filter the search and pop out a list of games relevant to their search.
6. These specific games will have 'favorite' buttons by them which will add it to the users' backlog list.
7. Below this search bar and list area is another area where you can see a list of other users' backlog lists.
8. When I click on these lists I am taken to that users page where I can see their full list of games they've added.
9. Besides each game is an "upvote" icon to click to "recommend" that game to the user. A user can upvote a single, couple, or even all games if they wish.
10. At a glance, this allows the user in question to see which games most of their peers recommends.
11. On your own personal page, the view is similar. Things displayed on a user page besides the games are a name, a profile picture, as well as games that you've played that are similar to games you're looking for.
12. There is a seperate tab for users to make posts about certain games they played that they either want to recommend or just talk about.
13. The user will have the option to make a post about a certain game when they pull it up in the search bar, which will take them to a posting area where they can see, create, and delete posts.
